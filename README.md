# phosphor-all

Build a selection of most phosphor JS modules into a single source file.
Intended to make it easy to use phosphorjs in Flexx.

Use `run.py` to generate/update. If you're only interested in the end
result, just download `phosphor-all.js`.

Note: the `phosphor-all.min.js` is currently not build because it seems
broken on Windows? Idea: do the building on Travis.
